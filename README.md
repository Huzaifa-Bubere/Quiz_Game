Java Console-Based Quiz Management System
This Java Console-Based Quiz Management System is a simple yet effective application designed to conduct quizzes with multiple-choice questions. It features two types of users: Admin and Student. The Admin can log in to add new quiz questions, which are stored in a text file (questions.txt). These questions include a query and four answer choices, with one correct answer specified. Admins can also view existing questions but cannot modify or delete them in this version. On the other hand, Students can log in to attempt the quiz, where they answer randomly retrieved multiple-choice questions. Their responses are checked against the correct answers stored in the file, and a score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

This project follows a console-based approach, meaning it runs entirely in the command line without a graphical interface. It relies on Javaâ€™s file handling capabilities to store and retrieve quiz data efficiently. The system ensures simple and interactive participation, prompting users with questions and allowing them to input their answers. Upon completing the quiz, students receive immediate feedback on their performance. The program is structured with separate classes for Admin functionalities, Student interactions, and file management, ensuring modularity and ease of modification.

This project is developed using core Java concepts such as OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), file handling, loops, and conditionals, making it ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of Java programming. Since the questions are stored in a text file, the system does not require a database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. The application can be extended with additional features like a scoring system, a time limit per question, user authentication, and a question randomization mechanism to enhance user engagement.

To run this project, simply compile the Java files and execute the main class. This Quiz Management System is an excellent starting point for learners who want to develop interactive Java applications using file-based storage.
